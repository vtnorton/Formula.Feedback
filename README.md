# 📰 The project (Formula.Feedback)

Use this Azure Function to send a message to yourself. This is built to send a feedback info from a HTTP POST using SendGrid.

USAGE: It is used to allow users of the app [Formula - Universal Code Editor](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/formula-universal-code-editor/9nblggh4wb6b) (version > 4) to send feedback to the developer [that's me].


## 👨🏻‍💻 How to run it

### ⚡ Azure Function
For the Azure Function (Formula.Feedback), I recommend develop it with vscode or Visual Studio.

You may need to adjust the `ProjectName`, `Email` and the `SENDGRID_KEY` at `local.settings.json` to your project name, e-mail and SendGrid key.


## 🔮 Roadmap

I'm sharing with you some of my plans to move forward with this project, right now the priorities comes like this:

* Tests: This project isn't complete without tests on it.

* Independency: Would love to make more stuff parameterizable so it can be used in other projects outside [vtnorton](https://vtnorton.com)

* Metrics: It would be incredible to get some metrics with this feedback sender, like the app version.

* Prettier: Make the final message looks prettier using heartthrob.

* Docker: The project needs docker, and that says it all!

* YAML: would love to create the build process with yml.

Constributors of all kinds from the community are welcome, but especially those that support the efforts above.


## ⭐Contribution reward

For each contribution you get a key for [Formula - Universal Code Editor](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/formula-universal-code-editor/9nblggh4wb6b), I will try my best to send to you once a contribution is set but if I forget to send you, just tell me!

For issues, it will only be valid once an issue is closed or resolved. 😉
